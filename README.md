# `Description`

This project is an indept user interactive analysis of historical bikeshare data from 3 major US cities (Chicago, New York City and Washington DC).

The user answers some questions like which city to analyse, the month of choice, etc, and on the basis of the feedback received, the program outputs insightful information including some descriptive statistics.

In it, we explored key trends like the most common hour, day, and month among the riders. We digged deep into the most popular start and end destinations and the results were amazing! Why not check it out yourself!
